Back end: Django For Local Development Getting Up and Running Locally With Docker The steps below will get you up and running with a local development environment. All of these commands assume you are in the root of your generated project. See also: https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/ Prerequisites Docker; if you don't have it yet, follow the installation instructions ; Docker Compose; refer to the official documentation for the installation guide . Build the Stack This can take a while, especially the first time you run this particular command on your development system: docker-compose -f local.yml build Generally, if you want to emulate production environment use production.yml instead. And this is true for any other actions you might need to perform: whenever a switch is required, just do it! Run the Stack This brings up both Django and PostgreSQL. The first time it is run it might take a while to get started, but subsequent runs will occur quickly. Open a terminal at the project root and run the following for local development: docker-compose -f local.yml up You can also set the environment variable COMPOSE_FILE pointing to local.yml like this: export COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml And then run: docker-compose up To run in a detached (background) mode, just:: docker-compose up -d (Optionally) Designate your Docker Development Server IP When DEBUG is set to True , the host is validated against ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '[::1]'] . This is adequate when running a virtualenv . For Docker, in the config.settings.local , add your host development server IP to INTERNAL_IPS or ALLOWED_HOSTS if the variable exists. Alternative: Virtual Environment for Python Prerequisites : Installation of Python 3, Pip, Django and a Unix/MacOS or Windows Machine As an alternative to Docker, the project can be developed in a virtual environment for python. To create a virtual environment, decide on a name, e.g. env_name and create on like so in a folder above or aside the project folder: python3 -m venv env_name To activate the virtual environment on Unix or MacOS on a level above the environment folder that was just created: source env_name/bin/activate On Windows: env_name\\Scripts\\activate.bat With the virtual environment at hand (and activated), the requirements for the projects can now be installed manually only to this environment: pip install requirements/local.txt For more information on virtual environments, please refer to the Python 3 tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html 2.

I would recommend PyCharm Professional. It is a powerful IDE for Python development but with support for Vue.js and comes with rich features regarding project navigation, highlighting, code completion, TODO management, integrated terminal or python console etc. It is developed by JetBrains and free of charge for students. Great and useful features for a project this size, are: Structure view: Cmd+7 (Mac) / Alt+7 (Win) Find file by name: Shift+Cmd+O (Mac) / Ctrl+F12 (Win) Find in files: Shift+Cmd+F (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+F (Win) All Shortcuts for Win/Linux: https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/pycharm/docs/PyCharm_ReferenceCard.pdf All Shortcuts for MacOS: https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/pycharm/docs/PyCharm_ReferenceCard_mac.pdf I have got problems understanding the project structure, any tips? The general structure of the project is divided into two parts: back end and front end. The back end is made with Django, a web framework based on python . The front end is made with Vue.js. Vue.js consists of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Both, Django and Vue.js are fairly easy to learn. Back end / Django First of all, the Django project itself is providing useful resources to get started with Django: Django Project For this project, for django a good start would also be the documentation of the Django REST Framework , as the back end provides an API for different applications. See Django REST Framework The Dengue Dashboard in particular is based on being a real-time web-application and therefore uses a full-duplex communication between the server and the client. That means that both, client and server, may always send each other messages after an initial connection is established. That couldn't be provided with normal HTTP REST communication as previous mentioned. For this purpose, the WebSocket protocol was implemented into the project, which made it necessary to implement Django Channels , that enables channeling the different protocols (HTTP/WebSockets). An incredibly useful article , to understand the structure of this project and the overview of handling different protocols in a real-time environment is to be found here: https://blog.heroku.com/in_deep_with_django_channels_the_future_of_real_time_apps_in_django . It is written by one of the core developers of Django and not only helps to understand the structure of this project, but also visualizes the concepts of Django Channels. To serve the API via WebSockets , the Django Channels REST Framework was used. In general, it is possible and common to serve .html files from the Django Templates folder. You can write html and specific Django syntax to render pages that will be served to the client. For this project however, Vue.js is used to create the files for the front end and display information to the client. The reason for this is, that Vue.js is a reactive JavaScript framework. It enables automatic updating of the page/DOM in case of updates to the data that is being displayed. Furthermore, with a JavaScript framework like this, it is possible to separate the data from it's representation. The front end is solely developed in the vue_frontend directory, whilst all of the other folders are connected to the back end. Besides Django, the back end also includes other frameworks/technologies that are e.g. used for deployment. To fully understand the files of the back end, one could look at the following technologies, that are used: Python Django (as a web framework based on python) Docker/Dockerfiles Shell Scripts Markdown (for Documentation purposes mostly) pip (package manager to install python packages) Front end / Vue.js The front end of the application is developed with Vue.js. The main reason besides the separation of content and representation is the reactivity. Through state-management it is possible, that the DOM automatically refreshes whenever changes to the represented data is made. This enhances the real-time feature of the web-application. Vue has got several other advantages such as that it is light-weighted and incrementally adoptable, thus scalable. A good starting point for Vue.js is the project website itself. Vue.js is open-source and well-documented. https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ To connect with the aforementioned WebSocket provided by the Django Channels REST Framework, a client side implementation is used. The maybe most important part in the front end implementation is the state-management. Vuex is a state-management pattern and library for Vue.js. The documentation for vuex delivers a good explanation of what vuex is and how it works. https://vuex.vuejs.org/ The following diagram gives a brief overview over the vuex state-management pattern from the aforementioned website. To fully understand the files of the front end, one could look at the following technologies: JavaScript HTML CSS Bootstrap (as a CSS framework that is used in the front end template) npm (package manager to install javascript packages) Vue.js Vuex (state-management) Single Page Applications WebPack (Bundling files into static assets) localhost:8000 is not showing the app. You started Docker but localhost:8000 is not showing the App? There is a couple of things that could be wrong here. Front end is not up and running First of all, make sure, that the front end is being served. You can achieve this by running npm install once and then npm run serve inside the vue_frontend directory of the project. npm run serve will serve the front end and enable hot reloading, which means that all changes made to the code will automatically refresh the page in the browser after saving the file. Cache is broken The app is made to make as little requests as necessary. That means, if some JavaScript or CSS file that is needed for the page was already loaded into the cache once, the page will most likely not request the same file again unless the file is marked as modified. This is one reason, why the webpack configuration, that bundles the front end .vue files to static .js and .css files generates a unique hash that is appended to every file. The files will be renewed in the browser after every build process. In local development however, the development cycle might lead to a broken cache, i.e. a cache, where files are mistaken to be the newest when they aren't. The easiest way to verify if that is the problem you are encountering is to delete the cached files or to see if the problem persists in a private window. Personal experience showed, that these caching problems in local development rarely occur, when building the project with npm run build after a developing session. Serving in the wrong location The standard port of local development for Vue.js is :8080 whereas the Docker will serve on port :8000 . Both will work, but localhost:8000 is preferable and used throughout the application. Depending on your system/machine it is possible, that localhost or 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 is not the IP that your Docker instance is serving the app on. Another possibility is, that the ports are not available to your host system or blocked by the firewall. Vue.js will usually automatically turn to another port then but in cases might not. So for debugging, you might follow these steps: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46176584/docker-bind-for-0-0-0-04000-failed-port-is-already-allocated Check your firewall settings for the ports Check the IP/Port of your docker process(es) When you encounter another IP than any of the localhost IPs, it is important to whitelist them in the django app ( ALLOWED_HOSTS ) and also to exchange all strings containing the localhost URL to your new IP. The ALLOWED_HOSTS can e.g. be altered in config/settings/local.py .
